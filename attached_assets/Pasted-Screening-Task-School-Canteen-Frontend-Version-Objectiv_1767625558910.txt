Screening Task – School Canteen
(Frontend Version)
Objective
You are helping a school build a simple web interface for their canteen’s digital ordering
system.
Students should be able to view snacks, place orders, and track how much they’ve spent
over time.
This is not a production-grade app — just a small prototype to demonstrate your ability to
build clean, modular, and reactive UI components using React (or Next.js).
Your focus should be on state management, API integration, component reusability, and
good UX.

Requirements
Build a React-based frontend that connects to the given backend (you can mock APIs
using JSON Server, MirageJS, or hardcoded mock data if necessary).
The system should support:
1. Viewing available snacks.
2. Creating students.
3. Placing orders.
4. Viewing student details including their spending and past orders.

You must demonstrate:
● Local/global state management (React Context, Redux, or Zustand).
● Form handling and validation (React Hook Form or similar).
● Component composition (e.g., reusable SnackCard, StudentListItem,
OrderForm).
● API integration (mocked or live endpoints).
● Good UI/UX practices (clear navigation, loading states, and error handling).

Core Pages / Components

1. Snacks Page
○ Displays all snacks with their name, price, and ordersCount.
○ Button to “Order” a snack → opens modal/form to choose student and
quantity (1–5).
2. Students Page
○ Displays list of all students.
○ Each student shows:
■ Name
■ Referral Code
■ Total Spent
■ Button to view detailed page.

3. Student Detail Page
○ Shows student info and a list of their orders:
■ Snack name
■ Quantity
■ Payable amount
○ Option to place a new order.
4. Create Student Form
○ Simple form with name input.
○ Referral code generated automatically (can be mocked).

Mock API Endpoints
(You can either mock with json-server or use your actual backend.)
GET /snacks
GET /students
GET /students/:id
POST /students
POST /orders

Bonus Points
● Use TypeScript.
● Use React Query or SWR for data fetching.
● Implement responsive design with TailwindCSS or styled-components.
● Include loading and error states.
● Store recent orders in local storage to simulate persistence.

Submission
1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. Include a README.md explaining:
○ Setup instructions.
○ Libraries used.
○ Mock data approach (if backend not used).
3. Include a file named PROMPTS_USED.md listing any prompts or AI tools you used.

Evaluation Criteria
● Code structure and clarity.
● Component design and reusability.
● State and data management.
● UX and accessibility.
● API interaction and error handling
